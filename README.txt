CARNIVAL GAME - Stacy Glushchenko, Riya Kulkarni, Anika Sharma 

Our project used Pygame as the toolset and the language Python to create a series of three mini games according to basic carnival games. 
The first of the three was a Balloon Pop game created by Anika Sharma. It allowed the player to move a sprite around that shot darts at balloons. There was a timer going and the goal was to hit all the balloons with the darts by navigating on the screen before the time ran out. This game included concepts from unit 2 such as while loops (2.4.1), for loops (2.4.2), and self as part of a declared parameter(2.5.7). 
The next game was a Hammer game made by Riya Kulkarni which prompted the user to click the button with a hammer a certain amount of times before the clock runs out. This game was based heavily off of the MOUSE BUTTON method with incrementation used to count the amount of clicks made, as well as if/else statements (2.4.3) to determine whether the user made the goal amount. 
Lastly, the Duck game was made by Stacy Glushchenko which is a game of luck where the player has to pick a lucky duck out of 10 swimming in a pool. This game required using lists and setting a certain amount of ducks in that list to be “star ducks” or lucky ducks. The mutator (2.5.5) and accessor (2.5.4) methods were crucial in this part of the project. The for loop was also required to create the 10 ducks in the pool incremented by 1. 
We pushed a repl version of all three mini games combined once done by Anika Sharma. 
The program depends on pygame and pygame.locals to create the window, check for user input, and more. Pygame is a set of modules to create games using python. The python imaging library (PIL) was imported to adjust the size of images we are using for our sprites. Time helps us get the current time, adjust frames per second, hold a window for a number of seconds, and more. We imported the random module to get random numbers used for the placement of objects and more.
